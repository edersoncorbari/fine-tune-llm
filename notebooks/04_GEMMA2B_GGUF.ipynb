    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the correct pipeline for converting a **LoRA-fine-tuned (QLoRA)** model into a **quantized GGUF** model, ready for use in local runtimes such as **llama.cpp**, **Jan**, **Ollama**, and **LM Studio**.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ An important note: **It is not possible to quantize a LoRA model directly**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The process requires a well-defined sequence of intermediate steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correct pipeline order\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Merge the LoRA adapter with the base model**  \n",
    "→ Produces a full model in **fp16 or bfloat16**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convert Hugging Face to GGUF (fp16)**  \n",
    "→ Using the official `llama.cpp` tooling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantize the GGUF model**  \n",
    "→ Formats such as **Q4 / Q5 / Q8**, depending on the desired balance between quality and memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Every **GGUF model is first created in fp16**. Quantization is only applied after this conversion step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, this workflow is applied to a **Gemma 2B** model fine-tuned for empathetic and psychologically safe responses, covering everything from LoRA merging to final quantization, inference testing, and publication to Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final merged model is publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **https://huggingface.co/ecorbari/Gemma-2b-it-Psych-GGUF**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: GGUF Conversion Without Local Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer **not to perform the conversion and quantization locally**, Hugging Face provides a simple and fully managed alternative via the following Space:\n",
